 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sun, 29 Jan 2012 09:57:24 +0100

neoraine (1.2.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed a bug in which NeoRaine would crash if not finding the audio track in the folder;
  * pause in lost focus state is now optional;
  * changed the behavior when leaving the NGCD BIOS interface;
  * now the NGCD BIOS file is detected in either lower and uppercase;

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sun, 29 Jan 2012 09:57:24 +0100

neoraine (1.2.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * some songs had their 1st 2 seconds cut on some tosec neocd dumps using
   indexes, fixed.
 - when loading a game working in 304x224, the screen is now totally cleared
   when changing the resolution, after the 1st loading animation.
 - you won't get anymore errors when saving a game after playing too long in
   kof, now the savegames use lists for the uploads and not a limited array.
 - ask for neocd bios if it can't be found (mainly useful for osx).

neoraine (1.2.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * This version mainly adds support to save the state of fm sound chips
    (music) in savegames and restore them correctly, it should help to get rid
	of the reports of sound corruption in neoraine.
  * It also fixes a problem with the command line of neoraine, adds a cheat to
    disable encounters in ssrpg, and tweaks some minor details. 

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 15 Dec 2011 20:40:16 +0100

neoraine (1.2.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * New translator for ssrpg, mainly, + console fixes and gui improvements

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 15 Dec 2011 20:37:23 +0100

neoraine (1.2.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * The last color palette was not correctly cleared when reseting, + some
    debuger fixes and some sound warnings removals.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Wed, 23 Dec 2009 09:17:27 +0100

neoraine (1.2.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Small bug fixes and improvements, most notably a better sync with music
    thanks to a float fps now, and a fix for savegames which didn't save
    correctly  the fix area when it was uploaded from the prg ram.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Wed, 02 Sep 2009 11:18:52 +0200

neoraine (1.2.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * There was again a bug in the crc calculation of the cache, which prevented
    neoraine to load a file it should have loaded from the game in some cases.
    Since I really had too many bugs of this kind, I completely disabled the
    optimization and thus fixed this bug for good this time. You should get
    much more reliable savegames now, especially with games which load tons of
    files like king of fighters. (It also affects normal play, when loading
    files between rounds).
  * See raine 0.51.5 changelog for generic changes in this version (gui,
    double bufer, etc...).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Tue, 07 Apr 2009 11:27:01 +0200

neoraine (1.2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a rare cache corruption bug (which could load some bad sprites in some
    very specific cases).
  * Better handling of commands to restart the same audio track (previously it
    was interpreted as unpause command)
  * Better support of cue files with multiple audio files in them (previously
    some files could very well not be found).
  * Support for starting indexes for audio tracks in cue files.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Wed, 25 Mar 2009 11:18:12 +0100

neoraine (1.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the stupid bug with "mute sfx" freezing the emulation
  * Fix a crash when trying to cancel "update sprite block" in neocd options.
  * Now correctly emulate the pause command sent to the audio cd before
    loading any file from the cd. The "Always stop cd music while loading"
    option moves from neocd options to sound options and is now set to yes by
    default, and is saved while you leave the emulator.
  * Speed hacks are coming back in a better form. The speed hacks
    autodetection could not work anymore for a few versions, it's working
    again now (try ironclad, you'll see the difference). There is now an
    option in "neocd options" to disable speed hacks if you fear the game
    might be a little faster with speed hacks enabled (it's not the case normaly
    speed hacks just make the animations smoother normaly, but there might be
    exceptions).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sun, 22 Mar 2009 00:48:10 +0100

neoraine (1.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed hq2x/3x in 16bpp, see raine changelog for details
  * Running games without sound emulation should now work correctly (very
    likely to crash previously !).
  * You can now choose in neocd options to always turn cd music off when
    loading a file, which is what the console was doing because it couldn't do
    both at the same time. It can still be usefull to do the same in some very
    rare cases, so it's your choice.
  * You can now mute either the sfx or the cd music in the sound options menu.
  * The default sfx volume and cd volume are now both 60, and there is an
    option to return to the default volumes in the sound menu.
  * When restoring a savegame new cdda commands are now always handled (they
    could be ignored in some cases before).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 13 Mar 2009 23:01:50 +0100

neoraine (1.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sound sample rate can only be 44 Khz in neoraine because of the audio cd
    tracks, so the sound options don't allow to change this.
  * When stopping sound emulation in the middle of a game the sound now stops
    immediately.
  * See raine changelog for version 0.51.0 for changes not specific to
    neoraine (gui, console, video...).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 16 Jan 2009 19:36:50 +0100

neoraine (1.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a crash when restoring a savegame in kof98 (too many pcm uploads)
  * Savegames could be badly restored starting in version 1.2.0 because of a
    change in the handling of the main ram. 
  * Added an error message when trying to load a game from a .cue file and the
    iso defined in the cue file is not readable.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 15 Jan 2009 23:30:46 +0100

neoraine (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The 1.2.x branch is targeted at editing neocd games, specially ssrpg.
  * The sprites blocks can't be toggled anymore with the layer keys, because
    you couldn't toggle every sprite block this way. Now F5 toggles the fix
    layer and f6 toggles all the sprites blocks. To toggle sprites blocks, use
    the backspace key (default key - can be changed in the gui) to enter
    capture mode, then browse the blocks using right and left arrows, and
    finally capture with the C key (preferably in pause mode !).
  * Added "update neocd sprite block" to neocd options, thid does the opposite
    of capture mode, it takes the pngs, and converts them back to sprites
    using the data saved while in capture mode.
  * Added a translator for ssrpg (and only ssrpg). Available in "Game
    Options" once the game is loaded. Should be used with the console to get
    the address of the string to translate (you can use break $55120 and
    display a0 to get the address, or break $6858 and then display a0 to get the
    address of a text printed ingame, character by character (dialog usually)).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 15 Aug 2008 11:28:25 +0200

neoraine (1.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * changes for the console : better handling of scripts in windows (fopen rb
    instead of r !!!), now correctly handles tabs in scripts, reports errors
    if console is hidden (during scripts execution), adds save and restore
    commands.
  * all the scripts for ssrpg have been updated to handle up to 3
    characters in the team at the same time (thanks to saaleh for the savegame
    which allowed me to do that !)

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Wed, 13 Aug 2008 11:16:26 +0200

neoraine (1.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * This version mainly takes the changes from raine 0.40.15 : joysticks are
    more responsive, and the console gets new commands which allow better
    cheats for ssrpg

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat, 09 Aug 2008 10:37:01 +0200

neoraine (1.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * fix loading a mode1/2352 image with animations enabled
  * Now supports audio tracks contained in the game image file (usually a bin
    file). I tested with a mode1/2048 image and a mode1/2352 one, so it should
    normally work everywhere. If you made your own image from a real cd, and
    all you can hear is a big "sssssshhhhhhh" instead of music, then there is
    a new option for you in sound options : "audio tracks format". Normally cd
    tracks should always be in lsb format, but some cd player swap the bytes
    when reading them, so you can try msb if the sound is broken for you, but
    normally you should never have to touch this option.
  * See raine changelog for the stupid gui fixes of previous version.
  * Basic support for playing directly an audio cd : if no external audio
    track can be found, then neoraine will try to play the 1st audio cd it can
    find. In linux it works only if you have the cable between the cdrom drive
    and your soundcard, in windows it works everywhere (converted to digital).
    This is the less "efficient" mode of playing : looping isn't supported,
    which means that in aero fighters the track won't loop during game play,
    and for now it doesn't try to save the current track position in
    savegames.
  * When a cd track was played until its end, it stopped completely the cdda
    and you couldn't hear anymore any track. It's fixed now.
  * The demo of street hoop didn't play correctly if loading animations were
    enabled. This bug affected only games which used the horizontal irq (very
    few)
  * disabled speed hack for magical drop 2 as it made the menu much harder to
    use !

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat, 10 May 2008 10:25:09 +0200

neoraine (1.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a few problems when switching between yuv layers and normal blits
  * Disabled double buffer for the gui in windows, this makes a lot of things
    much easier and already improves the look of some parts of the gui
  * Fixed the message "loading error" on some games.
  * neoraine could crash on a cd song change sometimes (thread bug - it's a
    one which happens only if you are unlucky !). It's fixed now.
  * The colors selection dialog gains some sliders controls, and you can now
    change the fg color to any color (if you chose a dark color in previous
    versions, you got something very ugly !). Notice that alpha is ignored for
    fg color, but it's better this way, transparent text becomes unreadable !
  * fix 8bpp mode (when launching neoraine on an 8bpp desktop), broken in many
    places (crashes, palette, etc...).
  * Prevent a possible crash when reseting a game, and prevent graphics
    corruption when reseting during the 1st animation while the fix area is
    being loaded

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat, 05 Apr 2008 17:14:27 +0200

neoraine (1.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the loading animations "flashes", during, after or before the
    animations (thanks to Juveno41 for the animation he found on youtube, it
    helped a lot !). It also finally explains why the animations of overtop
    were bad from level 2 : they were not supposed to be shown at all !
  * Fix a stupid mistake which could cause a bad restoration of savegames in
    some situations
  * Some part of the gui could remain visible after the game was started...
  * The depencies for raine and neoraine are now in different files to avoid
    to reproduce the mistake of version 1.1.2 with the bad windows binary !

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 14 Mar 2008 23:51:50 +0100

neoraine (1.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix the mess between default and custom controls created by the autofire
    saving ability
  * Prevent a crash when messing with the autofire before a game is actually
    loaded
  * Fix bad palette in kof96ng (it's a general fix, the palette actually uses
    a mirror).
  * The turbo control works as expected with a joystick too (release the
    control to stop the turbo effect).
  * Help the user from turning animations off in the middle of a loading
    animation and prevent last blade 2 from geting lost if we use a low speed
    of loading. Also make the loading progression bar slightly more precise,
    and survive if the user changes the cdrom speed in the middle of a loading
    animation.
  * small improvements to the gui, and added the ability to change most of the
    colors (gui options / Colors).
  * fixed speed too fast in some places for janshin (Quest of Jong Master)

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 13 Mar 2008 17:28:51 +0100

neoraine (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low aka "triple 1" !!!

  * The autofire options are fixed and they are now saved with your game
    options (as custom controls).
  * Fixed a stupid graphical glitch which can happen after a loading sequence
    (like on the title screen of last blade 2).
  * Fixed again scanlines (asm problem) + double pixel scaler (same problem)
  * Fixed a possible crash when using normal blits and loading a new game
  * Remapped custom keys : the multimedia keys were recognised before, bad
    very badly mapped since they could cause a serious buffer overflow. So
    they have been remapped and if you used some non standard keys in your
    mappings you'll have to remap them using the gui.
  * The loading is now progressive when animations are enabled, this produces
    a smoother animation and allows to better see some effects (notice that at
    speed > 2, it can still be not totally smooth because at these speeds the
    number of sectors loaded by frame can vary from frame to frame).
  * the turbo key (default: del) becomes like the game keys : keep it pressed
    to enable turbo, release it to go back to normal.
  * When changing a control, you now have the option to delete it.
  * Fix again some corruption in the savegames. This correction might fix some
    savegames saved before this version, but you might be obliged to create
    new savegames to be sure to get rid of the problem (tested with samsho4).
  * When loading a game with animations enabled and the game uses a resolution
    of 304x224, there could be some glitches left on the borders of the screen
    after the initial animation, it's fixed now.
  * Fix problems with starting some loading animations (breakers).
  * Add handling of direct writes to fix area for over top, the only game I
    know which needs this ! And fix the animations of overtop which were bad
    begining at level 2
  * Fix a remarquable bug with the memory pool : if you played in windowed
    mode with normal blits and resized the window while playing a game by
    draging a border of the window, the memory pool had an overflow after
    about 1s of resizing, which was ending in a violent crash !  The memory
    allocation is now more resistant to this kind of fun !
    Notice the bug could happen only if your window manager resizes the window
    in real time, that is if it sends redraw messages every time the size
    changes. MS Windows doesn't do that normaly, it happened in kde for me.
  * Until now if you pressed the windows key by mistake, windows throws you to
    the desktop, but if you were in the middle of a game, you had a ugly
    message when you came back, and raine/neoraine exited after you validate
    the message. Well it's windows specific behaviour... anyway now when you
    press this damned key, you are still thrown to the desktop (I don't think
    I can do anything to prevent this !), but you can continue your game when
    you come back with alt-tab. Notice that the game is not paused in this
    case !
  * Recompile the windows version of sdl_sound with smpeg support to be able
    to play some weird kind of mp3s called "free format" which couldn't be
    played in 1.1.0. Now if you find another unplayable format, the error
    message will appear on the game screen instead of the console since
    usually there is no console in windows ! ;-)
  * If starting a game which had a title bitmap (which appears after you have
    done "load game") in normal blits at a resolution such that width > 640
    and height < 480, then you had a crash. It's fixed too !

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Tue, 11 Mar 2008 09:16:26 +0100

neoraine (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switched from SDL_Mixer to SDL_Sound to decode audio tracks : no more
    weird crashes with electric fence, adds flac audio support for the audio
    tracks, and allows to save the position of the audio track in the
    savegames.
  * Fixed a problem with semi transparent sprites which showed only in puzzle
    bubble !
  * Setting the speed to 85% in aof2 didn't work, fixed
  * Fixed kof96 neocd collector demo, which was messing with interrupt
    vectors.
  * Added error messages in game when an audio track can't be loaded (either
    file unreadable, or track not found)
  * Added pseudo video layers keys to the neocd driver : you can now disable
    the 8 first sprites blocks + the fix layer using the F5..F12 keys. Notice
    that the sprites layers are logical layers, the hardware doesn't handle
    them directly.
  * Fixed the opening b demo in last blade 2 (option->demo viewer->opening b)
  * Inputs are now reseted when returning to the game, which avoids the
    problems when calling the gui while keeping a game key pressed.
  * fullheight scanlines + double width were kaput (old broken asm code)
  * Fix the blinking effect of scanlines in windows fullscreen with double
    buffer enabled
  * Add loading animations support - by default they play as they would with
    an 8x cdrom drive, it seems the best choice between too slow and too fast.
    You can change their speed in the neocd options in the gui (or set it to
    off to disable completely the animations).
  * Fix some possible corruption in the savegames, but old ones can still
    create corruption, try to use only savegames created with this version.
  * savegames are compatible again between linux & windows
  * handles the urls in history.dat without crashing.
  * You can finally change the keys for the video layers, go to the inputs
    section / Video layers...
  * Fixed loading directly an iso passed on the command line, it was broken
    since 1.0.5.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 06 Mar 2008 16:13:09 +0100

neoraine (1.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a stupid bug with the cache, never use xor to see if a memory area
    was changed. The + I now use is still not perfect, but it's much better,
    and it should be enough for what it's used.
  * Fixed a possible crash when loading a savegame because I had forgoten to
    turn the cd music off before restoring a savegame...
  * Add a "turbo" key : the default is del, you can change it in the gui, it
    just toggles the limit speed setting. If you are not limited by vsync, you
    can reach 700 fps in neoraine with yuv overlays when disabling the speed
    limitation with this key !

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Tue, 12 Feb 2008 19:37:47 +0100

neoraine (1.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix pcm handling in ssrpg (random battles)
  * fix speed hacks handling when raster frame is used (like in the demo of
    street hoop which was really too fast !!!)
  * add experimental support for mode2/2352 isos (normally neocd isos are all
    supposed to be mode1/2048, so usually mode2/2352 are bad rips, but
    sometimes they work anyway !!!).

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 25 Jan 2008 17:39:32 +0100

neoraine (1.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * cue files now support filenames up to 256 characters, and improved error
    messages for the cue files.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sun, 06 Jan 2008 11:49:53 +0100

neoraine (1.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fonts were badly rendered when forcing normal blits (instead of yuv
    overlays)
  * From the raine engine : fix a crash when choosing to change the video mode
    to the game resolution with scale 2x enabled.
  * Added a new speed hack for last resort.

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Sat, 05 Jan 2008 11:54:23 +0100

neoraine (1.0.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * now supports wav in cue files, and neocheats.cfg is the right version, not
    the test version as before !

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 04 Jan 2008 23:51:25 +0100

neoraine (1.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * removes the forgoten z80_check_w (debuging stuff)

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Fri, 04 Jan 2008 00:19:25 +0100

neoraine (1.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed corrupted line in the about dialog when displaying it for the 2nd
    time
  * Allow the sfx volume and music volume to be set to more than 100% (until
    200%) for games with too quiet samples.
  * fixed crash in last resort (at start)
  * games which upload to the pcm area can also use savegames now (previously
    trying to save such a game exited neoraine)
  * startup.bin becomes obsolete and is removed
  * last blade 2 had lost its title screen because it was trying to use dma
    for its uploads, it's now supported.
  * Pulstar gains a speed hack too.
  * Fixed the huge bug with the sfx sound only on the left side, it's now
    stereo, sorry !!!

 -- Emmanuel Anne <manu@manu-home.hd.free.fr>  Thu, 03 Jan 2008 23:39:50 +0100

neoraine (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Samurai spirits rpg fix : there was a specific video priority problem
